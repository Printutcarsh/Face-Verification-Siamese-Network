# Face-Verification-Siamese-Network
A Face Verification Siamese Network implemented using Keras.
# Step By Step Implementation Guide
<ul>
  <li> The first step is to download all the files in the same folder </li>
  <li> Afterthat as we are focused on faces so we have to first extract faces from the images and store them in a folder.<br>
    For that run face_extract.py in your command prompt and also write the name of the dataset folder in the dataset like this:-<br>
    <b>python face_extract.py trainset</b>
  </li>
  <li> Then we have to process the data and have to make image pairs and its corresponding label and save them.<br>
    For this run data_preprocessing.py</li>
</ul>
